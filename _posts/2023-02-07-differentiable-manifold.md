## Differentiable manifold

Given a manifold $M$ and its atlas $\mathcal{A}$, let's think of transition maps.
If all _transition maps_ are differentiable, $M$ is a **differentiable manifold**.
Furthermore, if all transition maps are $C^k$, $M$ is a **$C^k$-manifold**.

We can think of following concepts, too.
* $C^1$-manifold : differentiable manifold
* $C^\infty$-manifold : smooth manifold
* $C^\omega$-manifold : analytic manifold

Since differentiable manifolds are the main objects of differential geometry, in many cases,
unless otherwise noted, manifold refer to a differentiable manifold.
