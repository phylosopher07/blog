## Mass

**Mass** is an intrinsic property of a body.
Mass can be experimentally defined as a measure of the body's inertia, 
eaning the resistance to acceleration when a net force is applied.
The object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.
Mass is represented by the symbol $m$.

## Momentum

**Momentum**(more specifically linear momentum) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object.
If $m$ is an object's mass and $\b{v}$ is its velocity, then the object's momentum $\b{p}$ is :

$ \b{p} = m\b{v} $

## Force

**Force** is an influence that can change the motion of an object.
A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity, i.e., to accelerate.
Force is represented by the sembol $F$.

Let's learn more about force later.
