## Linear subspace

If $V$ is a $K$-vector space $W$ is a subset of $V$, then $W$ is a **linear subspace** of $V$ if 
$W$ is a vector space over $K$ under the operations of $V$.
Equivalently, a nonempty subset $W$ is a subspace of $V$ if arbitary linear combinations of some vectors of $W$
are also an element of $W$.

* $ W \subset V $
* $ \b{w}_1,\b{w}_2\in W,\; \alpha,\beta\in F \Rightarrow \alpha\b{w}_1+\beta\b{w}_2\in W$

It's sometimes denoted as $W \le V$, but but these aren't common enough to be used without
explicitly specifying their meaning first.

As a corollary, all vector spaces are equipped with at least two linear subspaces: 
 - The zero vector space
 - The vector space itself

These are called the **trivial subspaces** of the vector space.


## Linear span

The **linear span**(i.e. span / linear hull) of a set $S$, which is a subset of a vector space over a field $F$, 
is defined as the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in $S$.

* $ \span(S) \coloneqq \Set{ \dsum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i\b{v}_i \| k\in\N,\; \b{v}_i\in S,\; \lambda_i\in F} $

To express that a vector space $V$ is a linear span of a subset $S$, one commonly uses the following phrases:
 - $S$ spans $V$
 - $S$ is a spanning set of $V$
 - $V$ is spanned/generated by $S$
 - $S$ is a generator or generator set of $V$

If $S$ is a subset of a vector space $V$, then the span of $S$ is a subspace of $V$.
 * $ S \subset V \Rightarrow \span(S) \le V $
