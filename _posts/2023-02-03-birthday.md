Today is my **Birthday**! ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰<br>
I'm so glad to get congratulations from many friends.

I made a background music feature just a moment ago. <br>
I added Debussy's 'Serenade for the Doll' to this post, the third piece of Children's Corner.
I like this piece because it simultaneously excites and calms me. Love Debussy.

Maybe the process of building a blog is almost finished; I implemented most of the functions I wanted, such as
comments, page views, subcategories, Google Analytics, etc. There are just a few designs left to be modified a bit.

I think the article is too short compared to the background music. ðŸ˜“ <br>
Let's appreciate it then, peacefully. ðŸŽ¹ ~~
